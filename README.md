# Stickee Developer Challenge
This repository features a Java solution for the Stickee Developer Challenge, set by Magpie Technology for the Software Developer Internship.

## Wally's Widgets developer challenge - stickee.pdf

This .pdf file contains the challenge description.

## WallysWidgets.java

WallysWidgets.java is the solution for the challenge.

## WallyWidgetsConsoleTests.java

WallyWidgetsConsoleTests.java runs several typical test cases with different packages and prints them to the console for the user to see. It is a quicker method
then altering the main method of the WallysWidgets.java file.

## CombinationSum.java

The CombinationSum.java file is executed indirectly via the WallysWidget.java file. The file is a slightly modified version of a solution for the Combination Sum
Leetcode problem (https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/), and was originally authored by cherryljr (https://github.com/cherryljr/LeetCode/blob/master/Combination%20Sum.java).

## JDoodle

The solution to the Stickee Developer Challenge can be run on an online environment here: www.jdoodle.com/ia/5J3

### JDoodle Notes
 - The source code within the files at JDoodle may take a few seconds to load. (This seems especially so for the WallyWidgetsConsoleTests.java file).
 - To run a class in JDoodle (either the WallyWidgetsConsoleTests.java or WallyWidgets.java file), mark the class as a 'Start File' via the horizontal burger menu, and click execute.
