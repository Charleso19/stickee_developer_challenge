# Stickee Developer Challenge
This repository features a Java solution for the Stickee Developer Challenge, set by Magpie Technology for the Software Developer Internship.

## Wally's Widgets developer challenge - stickee.pdf

This .pdf file contains the challenge description.

## WallysWidgets.java

WallysWidgets.java is the solution for the challenge. The solution is run by compiling the file into ByteCode (WallysWidgets.class) and then running the file via the terminal/IDE. **Alternatively, WallysWidgets.java can be run on an online environment here: jdoodle.com/ia/5qC**

## WallysWidgetsTest.java

WallysWidgetsTest.java is the file containing JUnit 5 tests for the WallysWidget.java file. It must have the Junit 5 library (**junit-platform-console-standalone-1.7.0-all.jar**) to run and is here mainly for demonstration purposes as it cannot be deployed to the online environment. The JUnit 5 .jar file is present in the repo if one wishes to run the tests.

## Notes
- To change the widget order number, alter the code in the main method.
- To change the size and/or amount of packages, alter the PACKAGES variable near the top of the code.
