# Stickee Developer Challenge
This repository features a Java solution for the Stickee Developer Challenge, set by Magpie Technology for the Software Developer Internship.

The .pdf file contains the challenge description.

WallysWidgets.java is the solution for the challenge.

WallysWidgetsTest.java is the file containing the JUnit 5 tests for the WallysWidget.java file.

WallysWidgets.java is run by compiling the file into ByteCode (WallysWidgets.class) and then running the file via the terminal/IDE.

Additionally, the file can be run on an online environment here: [LINK]

To change the widget order number, alter the code in the main method.
To change the size and/or amount of packages, alter the PACKAGES variable near the top of the code.
