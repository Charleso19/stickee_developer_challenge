# Stickee Developer Challenge
This repository features a Java solution for the Stickee Developer Challenge, set by Magpie Technology for the Software Developer Internship.

## Wally's Widgets developer challenge - stickee.pdf

This .pdf file contains the challenge description.

## WallysWidgets.java

WallysWidgets.java is the solution for the challenge.

## WallyWidgetsConsoleTests.java

WallyWidgetsConsoleTests.java runs several typical test cases with different packages and prints them to the console for the user to see. It is a quicker method
then altering the main method of the WallysWidgets.java file.

## CombinationSum.java

The CombinationSum.java file is executed indirectly via the WallysWidget.java file. The file is a slightly modified version of a solution for the Combination Sum
Leetcode problem (https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/), and was originally authored by cherryljr (https://github.com/cherryljr/LeetCode/blob/master/Combination%20Sum.java).

## How to run the solution: JDoodle

**The solution to the Stickee Developer Challenge can be run on an online environment here:** www.jdoodle.com/ia/5J3

One should run either the WallyWidgetsConsoleTests.java or the WallyWidgets.java file.

The packages and number of widgets to order can be altered within the WallyWidgetsConsoleTests.java file. Alternatively, if one wishes to run the WallyWisgets.java file, the packages can be altered in the main method on line 314; the number of widgets to be ordered can also be altered in the main method on line 315.

### JDoodle Notes
 - The source code within the files at JDoodle may take a few seconds to load. (This seems especially so for the WallyWidgetsConsoleTests.java file).
 - To run a class in JDoodle (either the WallyWidgetsConsoleTests.java or WallyWidgets.java file), mark the class as a 'Start File' via the horizontal burger menu, and click execute.
